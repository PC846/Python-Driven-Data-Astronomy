# Python-Data-Driven-Astronomy
 
 
 This is a course that I wanted to do to practice my data manipulation skills (and learn some more cool stuff about Astronomy!) It is all done in Python 3 using Numpy and Astropy. In this course, I would be working with large datasets (ex. FITs), databases, and using machine learning tools to learn from my data. It comes with a series of assignments and quizzes that I will document here to show my progress -- no matter how small or large.
 
 Due to some errors from the previous repository, I have remade it again and recommitted it all.
